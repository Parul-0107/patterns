ithey are dull
- they do not describe a genuine industry-based problem
- they do not describe research' i.e, tjhey do not critical evaluate their solution
- they paper is just an advertisement for some commential product
- there is some general lesson that could be used at some site other than this one
- there is some statement of limitations to the study and how "it" might be done better in future


I wonder if they should be done *in* industry and *with/by* industry.
If not, then are they just an academic research project that happens
to use Industry example and/or data  i.e. no different to any other
academic/research paper?

Scope

Research papers to be published in this track are expected to provide
value to practitioners that aim at triggering innovation and
operational excellence inside their organisations based on relevant
industrial research findings, or to researchers by providing
practitioner insights to help them focus their research on practically
relevant problems. Hence, we envision publications of this track
to help bridging the gap between theory and practice and to achieve
high academic and practical impact.

Submission Types

We invite submissions in a similar scope of our journal’s main
track, as long as there is a clear industry focus. More specifically,
we are interested in submissions that fit into one of the following
two categories:

Applied Research (“out of the lab, into the wild”): In this category,
we invite submissions that report results (positive or negative)
concerning the experience of applying/evaluating systems and software
technologies (methods, techniques and tools) in real industrial
settings. These comprise empirical studies conducted in industry
(e.g., action research, case studies) or experience reports that
may help understanding situations in which technologies really work
and their impact. Submissions should include information on the
industrial setting, provide motivation, explain the events leading
to the outcomes, including the challenges faced, summarize the
outcomes, and conclude with lessons learned, take-away messages,
and practical advice based on the described experience. An extensive
description of related work or background material is not required.
Similarly, extensive details on the research methodology (if needed
to assess the scientific rigour) should be reported as part of an
appendix. While papers in this category will be evaluated also based
on their scientific rigor, the focus is on their merit in reporting
practically relevant results rather than in terms of academic
(theoretical) novelty. At least one contributing author must be
from industry.

Practitioner Insights: In this category, we invite experience reports
showing what actually happens in practical settings, illustrating
the challenges (and pain) that practitioners face, and presenting
lessons learned. Problem descriptions with significant details on
the context, underlying causes and symptoms, and technical and
organizational impact are also welcome. Practitioner insights papers
may also comprise invited opinionated views on the evolution of
chosen topic areas in practice.  Submissions in this category are
limited to four pages and the first author must be from industry.

Not in scope of the In Practice track are secondary studies (e.g.
systematic literature reviews), studies carried out in artificial
settings (e.g. controlled experiments carried out in academic
settings), and studies with limited potential for scaling up to
practice (e.g. survey research that is not exclusively directed at
analysing contemporarily used practices, problems, or perceptions
in practice). Kindly note that rather than inviting traditional
research papers written and carried out by researchers and having
co-authors from practice, the focus on this track is to serve as a
catalyst for submissions emerging from practical settings. Hence,
all submissions will be evaluated through industry-appropriate
criteria and having at least one reviewer with an industry-affine
affiliation. The track aims at establishing a forum for industry-related
researchers and practitioners to disseminate results and make their
voice being heard.
