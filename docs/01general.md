# The General Standard


## Application
This general standard applies to all software engineering studies that collect and analyze data. It should be complemented
by more specific guidelines where available.

## Initial Checks (Editor)

Reviewers should only be invited for papers with the following attributes. By assigning reviewers, the
editor/chair/administrator is confirming that the manuscript meets these criteria:

- meets venue’s requirements (e.g. length, author-blinding, appropriate keywords)
- within the venue’s scope
- meets the minimum level of language quality acceptable to the journal
- cites other scholarly works
- presents new analysis not previously published in a peer-reviewed venue (i.e. preprints are fine)
- does not include unattributed verbatim published text (i.e. plagiarism)

## Initial Checks (Reviewer)

Before beginning to review a paper, assigned reviewers should verify the following.

- reviewer has no conflicts of interest; if unsure, check with the chair or editor
- reviewer has sufficient expertise; if unsure, check with the chair or editor and clarify what you can(not) evaluate
- paper is clear enough (in language and presentation) to even review

- Essential:
  - states a purpose, problem, objective, or research question
  - methodology is appropriate (not necessarily optimal) for stated purpose or questions
  - describes in detail what, where, when and how data were collected
  - describes in detail how the data were analyzed
  - discusses and validates assumptions of any statistical tests used.
  - presents results; results directly address research questions
  - discusses the importance, implications and limitations (validity threats) of the study
  - contributes in some way to the collective body of knowledge (see Replications Supplement)
  - supports claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence (data/observations) defines jargon, acronyms and key concepts
  - language is not misleading; any grammatical problems do not substantially hinder understanding
  - visualizations/graphs are not misleading (see the Information Visualization Supplement  complies with all applicable empirical standards
