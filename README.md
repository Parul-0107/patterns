# Research Patterns: Why? What?


There is not "one way" to do research. Rather,
researchers should be free to follow the forms that make
sense for their work. 

That said, when lots of people work on similar
things, then there evolves 
a set of community norms, which we call _patterns_,
that describe good and bad practice within that community.

This repository is an experiment in letting a large community
write those patterns. What is proposed here is a framework that includes several
of the "hot topics" in SE research: the need to have clearer reviewer guidelines
for different kinds of papers; the need to explore more this community's definitions
of _good_ and _bad_ research, the desire to publish research reports and artifact papers.

The workflow suggested here is:

-  Authors can browse, review, and suggest revisions to those patterns.
- Those proposed changes are then reviewed
  by experiences researchers (e.g. Associate editors or program board members)  
  and, it they make sense, they will update the patterns.
- Papers are then submitted, and reviewed, using the appropriate patterns.

Patterns provide guidance for best practices when writing:

- _Motivation_: a motivational statement on why doing some new work is important;
- _Method_: the details on this will be investigated;
- _Results_: the results seen when the authors apply the method.
- _Future Work_: statements of what should follow on from this work.

Not all papers need details on  of all these
four parts. In fact, it is good practice to divide these into separate papers:

- An initial (and short) _open issues_ paper can just be about _motivation_ and
  _method_. Reviewers can offer improvements to make this paper conform to known patterns.
  By keeping these papers short, they can be kept short, thus enabling quick review
  times.
- A subsequent (and longer) _findings_ paper that describes the results from the method. 

Patterns-friendly venues encourage both _open issues_ and _findings_ papers
by encouraging _open issues_ authors faster review times if they submit
the subsequent  _findings_ paper  to the same venue.

## Patterns and Artifacts

Patterns have a structure; i.e. a list of artifacts that
make up a paper (and different kinds of papers will need different patterns).
Here is a list of artifacts that might make up a paper. This list
is hardly complete and many of the following are not relevant for all papers.
Also, just to say the obvious,
some papers will be artifacts not listed below.


1. _Motivational statements_   or reports or challenge statements or lists of open issues that prompt an analysis; 
1. _Hypotheses_,  about expected effects in some area;
1. _Checklists_ used to design the analysis (see also, 
      the Checklist Manifesto
      (http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/);
1. _Bibliographies_, comprehensive, annotated, and insightful (e.g. showing the development or open areas in a field);
1. _Study instruments_ such as surveys interview scripts, etc;
1. _Statistical tests_ used to analyze results (along with some notes explaining why or when this test is necessary);
1. _Commentary_ on scripts used in the analysis;
1. Examples of particularly _informative visualizations_ 
  (e.g. Sparklines http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001OR )
1. _Baseline results_ against which new work can be compared;
1. _Sampling procedures_ e.g. ``how did you choose the projects you studied?'';
1. _Patterns_ describing  best practices for performing this kind of analysis;
1. _Anti-patterns_   describing cautionary tales of ``gotchas'' to avoid when doing this kind of work;
1. _Negative results_  that are anti-patterns, backed up by empirical results;
1. _Tutorial materials_: Guides to help  newcomers become proficient in the area. Some of these tutorial materials  may be generated by the researcher and others may be collected from other sources.
1. _New results_  that offer guidance on how to best handle future problems.
1. _Future work:_  From the results, there many be speculations about open issues of future issues that might become the  motivation  for the next round of research.
1. The _actual text_   of an author's papers;
1. Any  _data_ used in an analysis
    + Either  _raw_ from a project;
    + Or some _derived_ product.
   Note that some data is too large to fit into the standard on-line freely available repos (e.g. Github only allows 1GB reps). For such data, we suggest using some file `XXX.goto`; each line of which is one url where the related data can be collected. 
1. _Scripts_  used to perform the analysis (the main analysis or the subsequent statistical tests or visualizations; e.g.    the  [Python Sparklines generator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysparklines)). Scripts can also implement some of the patterns
  identified by the paper.
1. _Executable  models_ that can generate exemplar data;  or which offer an executable form of current hypotheses;
1. _Programs_ that realize the algorithms presented or used in the paper;
1. _Delivery tools_ to let novices automatically rerun the analysis; e.g.
    + Config management files that can
       + build the system/ paper from raw material and/or
       + update the relevant files using some package manager
    +  Virtual machines containing all the above scripts, data, etc, pre-configured such that a newcomer can automatically run the old analysis.
